1. Read the design and implementation document to understand the full scope.
2. Check progress.txt to see what has been completed.
3. Decide which story to work on next based on:
   - Dependencies (earlier milestones before later ones)
   - Logical ordering within epics
   - YOUR assessment of highest priority
   - NOT necessarily the first uncompleted item
4. Implement the chosen story completely:
   - Write the necessary code
   - Run type checks and tests if applicable
   - Ensure acceptance criteria are met
5. Append your progress to progress.txt with:
   - Story ID completed (e.g., M1-E1-S1)
   - Brief summary of what was implemented
   - Any blockers or notes for next iteration
6. Make a git commit for the completed work.
7. STICK TO THE PLAN, DO NOT TAKE SHORTCUTS
8. Check tasks, make sure complete all the tasks

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE STORY/TASK PER ITERATION.
