# Welcome to Seeknal

> **Build data pipelines and ML features in minutes, not days.**

Seeknal is an all-in-one platform for data and AI/ML engineering. Define transformations in YAML or Python, run them with DuckDB or Spark, and deploy features to production with a single CLI.

## What Can You Build With Seeknal?

| For ML Engineers | For Data Engineers | For Analytics Engineers |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Feature stores** with point-in-time correctness | **ELT pipelines** with incremental execution | **Semantic layers** with consistent metrics |
| **Training datasets** from raw events | **Data transformations** with SQL | **Business metrics** with change tracking |
| **Online serving** for real-time inference | **Multi-engine workflows** (DuckDB + Spark) | **Self-serve analytics** for stakeholders |

**Common use cases:** Recommendation systems, churn prediction, customer segmentation, real-time dashboards, A/B test analysis, fraud detection.

## Get Started in 10 Minutes

**[→ Quick Start Guide](getting-started-comprehensive.md)**

1. Install Seeknal (`pip install seeknal` or from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mta-tech/seeknal/releases))
2. Load your data (CSV, Parquet, database)
3. Transform with SQL
4. Run your first pipeline

No infrastructure required. Works on your laptop.

## How Seeknal Works: The Pipeline Builder

Seeknal's workflow is inspired by modern infrastructure tools like `terraform` and `kubectl`:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│     init        │ →   │     draft       │ →   │     apply       │ →   │   run --env     │
│  (setup project)│     │  (write YAML)   │     │  (save changes) │     │  (execute)      │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

### Step-by-Step

1. **`seeknal init`** - Create a new project
2. **`seeknal draft`** - Generate YAML templates for sources, transforms, feature groups
3. **`seeknal apply`** - Save your pipeline definition (like `git commit`)
4. **`seeknal run --env prod`** - Execute in production with safety checks

**Key benefits:** Dry-run validation, change detection, rollback support, multi-environment support, and multi-target materialization (PostgreSQL + Iceberg).
