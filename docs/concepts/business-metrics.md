# Business Metrics

**Coming Soon** - This concept is under development.

## Overview

Business metrics are quantifiable measures used to track and assess the status of a specific business process.

## Key Concepts

### Metric Types

- **Simple Metrics** — Single-measure aggregations
- **Ratio Metrics** — Numerator/denominator calculations
- **Cumulative Metrics** — Running totals and YTD
- **Derived Metrics** — Compositions of other metrics

### Metric Design

- **Single Source of Truth** — Define once, use everywhere
- **Business Language** — Use terms stakeholders understand
- **Governed** — Controlled definitions prevent inconsistencies
- **Self-Serve** — Non-technical users can build queries
