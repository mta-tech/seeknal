        An all-in-one platform for data and AI/ML engineering

Seeknal is a platform that abstracts away the complexity of data transformation and AI/ML engineering. It is a collection of tools that help you transform data, store it, and use it for machine learning and data analytics.

Seeknal lets you:

- **Define** data and feature transformations from raw data sources using Pythonic APIs and YAML.
- **Register** transformations and feature groups by names and get transformed data and features for various use cases including AI/ML modeling, data engineering, business metrics calculation and more.
- **Share** transformations and feature groups across teams and company.

Seeknal is useful in multiple use cases including:

- AI/ML modeling: computes your feature transformations and incorporates them into your training data, using point-in-time joins to prevent data leakage while supporting the materialization and deployment of your features for online use in production.
- Data analytics: build data pipelines to extract features and metrics from raw data for Analytics and AI/ML modeling.
