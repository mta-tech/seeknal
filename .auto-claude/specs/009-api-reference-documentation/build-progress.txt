=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Seeknal API Reference Documentation
Workspace: 009-api-reference-documentation
Started: 2026-01-04

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: This is a new feature addition to the project infrastructure. We are creating a documentation system from scratch, including tooling setup (MkDocs), configuration files, documentation structure, and deployment pipeline.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 9
- Total subtasks: 33
- Created init.sh
- Updated context.json with codebase investigation findings

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (MkDocs Setup and Configuration): 4 subtasks, depends on []
  - Install MkDocs tooling and create base configuration

- Phase 2 (Docstring Coverage Audit): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-1-setup]
  - Scan Python files to identify missing/incomplete docstrings

- Phase 3 (Enhance Core Module Docstrings): 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-2-docstring-audit]
  - Add/enhance docstrings for Project, Entity, Flow, Context

- Phase 4 (Enhance FeatureStore Module Docstrings): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-2-docstring-audit]
  - Complete docstrings for FeatureStore classes

- Phase 5 (Enhance Tasks Module Docstrings): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-2-docstring-audit]
  - Add comprehensive docstrings to tasks module

- Phase 6 (Create API Reference Pages): 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-3-core-docstrings, phase-4-featurestore-docstrings, phase-5-tasks-docstrings]
  - Create MkDocs pages for auto-generated API documentation

- Phase 7 (Add Code Examples): 5 subtasks, depends on [phase-6-api-pages]
  - Create code example pages for common patterns

- Phase 8 (Documentation Deployment Setup): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-7-examples]
  - Create GitHub Actions workflow for deployment

- Phase 9 (Final Verification and Testing): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-8-deployment]
  - Verify all documentation builds correctly and meets acceptance criteria

Services Involved:
- main: Python library (src/seeknal/)

Key Investigation Findings:
- Source code located in src/seeknal/ (NO lib/ directory exists)
- Docstrings follow Google style format
- Some classes already well-documented (FeatureStoreFileOutput, OfflineStore, Entity)
- Many methods lack docstrings (Project, Flow methods need enhancement)
- No existing documentation tooling - building from scratch
- Python 3.11+ codebase using pyproject.toml with hatchling

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 3
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups:
  - Phases 3, 4, 5 can run in parallel (all depend only on phase 2, different file sets)
  - Expected speedup: Minimal (~30 mins saved if parallelized)

Verification Strategy:
- Risk level: medium
- Test types: unit, integration
- Security scanning: not required
- Staging deployment: not required
- Key verification: mkdocs build --strict, pytest tests/

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  cd /Users/fitrakacamarga/project/mta/signal
  pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
  mkdocs serve

Or use the init script:

  ./.auto-claude/specs/009-api-reference-documentation/init.sh

=== END SESSION 1 ===

=== SESSION: Final Verification (2026-01-05) ===

subtask-9-1: Verify all public APIs are documented
Status: COMPLETED

Verification Results:
- Documentation build: SUCCESS (mkdocs build completed in 6.57 seconds)
- API Pages Generated: 4 (index.md, core.md, featurestore.md, tasks.md)

Documentation Coverage:
- Core API (site/api/core/index.html): 68 doc-contents sections
  - Project: ✅ documented with get_or_create, update, list, get_by_id
  - Entity: ✅ documented with get_or_create, update, list, set_key_values
  - Flow: ✅ documented with run, from_dict, get_or_create, list, update, delete
  - FlowInput/FlowOutput: ✅ documented with enums
  - Context: ✅ documented with copy, get, to_dict
  - Configuration: ✅ documented with all helper functions
  - Validation: ✅ documented with all validators
  - Exceptions: ✅ documented

- FeatureStore API (site/api/featurestore/index.html): 117 doc-contents sections
  - FeatureGroup: ✅ documented with all methods
  - FeatureLookup: ✅ documented
  - HistoricalFeatures: ✅ documented
  - OnlineFeatures: ✅ documented
  - OfflineStore/OnlineStore: ✅ documented
  - Feature/FillNull: ✅ documented
  - Storage Enums: ✅ documented
  - Output configs: ✅ documented

- Tasks API (site/api/tasks/index.html): 173 doc-contents sections
  - Task (base): ✅ documented with add_input, transform, add_common_yaml
  - SparkEngineTask: ✅ documented with all 25+ methods
  - DuckDBTask: ✅ documented
  - Stage/Stages: ✅ documented
  - Transformers: ✅ documented (SQL, AddColumnByExpr, FilterByExpr, etc.)
  - Extractors: ✅ documented (PostgreSQLExtractor, etc.)
  - Loaders: ✅ documented (PostgreSQLLoader, etc.)
  - Aggregators: ✅ documented (Aggregator, LastNDaysAggregator, etc.)

All public APIs in Project, Entity, Flow, FeatureStore, and Task modules
have been verified to appear in the built documentation with docstrings visible.

Note: griffe warnings about missing type annotations are expected - these are
informational only and indicate the source code lacks Python type hints while
docstrings document types. The build succeeds and generates correct documentation.
