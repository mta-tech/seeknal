=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Seeknal API Reference Documentation
Workspace: 009-api-reference-documentation
Started: 2026-01-04

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: This is a new feature addition to the project infrastructure. We are creating a documentation system from scratch, including tooling setup (MkDocs), configuration files, documentation structure, and deployment pipeline.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 9
- Total subtasks: 33
- Created init.sh
- Updated context.json with codebase investigation findings

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (MkDocs Setup and Configuration): 4 subtasks, depends on []
  - Install MkDocs tooling and create base configuration

- Phase 2 (Docstring Coverage Audit): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-1-setup]
  - Scan Python files to identify missing/incomplete docstrings

- Phase 3 (Enhance Core Module Docstrings): 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-2-docstring-audit]
  - Add/enhance docstrings for Project, Entity, Flow, Context

- Phase 4 (Enhance FeatureStore Module Docstrings): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-2-docstring-audit]
  - Complete docstrings for FeatureStore classes

- Phase 5 (Enhance Tasks Module Docstrings): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-2-docstring-audit]
  - Add comprehensive docstrings to tasks module

- Phase 6 (Create API Reference Pages): 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-3-core-docstrings, phase-4-featurestore-docstrings, phase-5-tasks-docstrings]
  - Create MkDocs pages for auto-generated API documentation

- Phase 7 (Add Code Examples): 5 subtasks, depends on [phase-6-api-pages]
  - Create code example pages for common patterns

- Phase 8 (Documentation Deployment Setup): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-7-examples]
  - Create GitHub Actions workflow for deployment

- Phase 9 (Final Verification and Testing): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-8-deployment]
  - Verify all documentation builds correctly and meets acceptance criteria

Services Involved:
- main: Python library (src/seeknal/)

Key Investigation Findings:
- Source code located in src/seeknal/ (NO lib/ directory exists)
- Docstrings follow Google style format
- Some classes already well-documented (FeatureStoreFileOutput, OfflineStore, Entity)
- Many methods lack docstrings (Project, Flow methods need enhancement)
- No existing documentation tooling - building from scratch
- Python 3.11+ codebase using pyproject.toml with hatchling

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 3
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups:
  - Phases 3, 4, 5 can run in parallel (all depend only on phase 2, different file sets)
  - Expected speedup: Minimal (~30 mins saved if parallelized)

Verification Strategy:
- Risk level: medium
- Test types: unit, integration
- Security scanning: not required
- Staging deployment: not required
- Key verification: mkdocs build --strict, pytest tests/

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  cd /Users/fitrakacamarga/project/mta/signal
  pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
  mkdocs serve

Or use the init script:

  ./.auto-claude/specs/009-api-reference-documentation/init.sh
