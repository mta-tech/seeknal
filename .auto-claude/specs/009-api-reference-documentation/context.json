  "task_description": "# API Reference Documentation\n\nGenerate comprehensive API reference documentation from docstrings covering all public classes, functions, and configurations. Include examples for common use cases.\n\n## Rationale\nProper API documentation is essential for adoption and reduces support burden. The current README is insufficient for production use. This addresses the known gap of limited documentation.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a developer, I want to understand available APIs without reading source code\n- As a team lead, I want my team to self-serve on Seeknal knowledge\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All public APIs are documented with descriptions, parameters, and return types\n- [ ] Each major module has an overview section explaining its purpose\n- [ ] Code examples are included for common patterns\n- [ ] Documentation is auto-generated from docstrings and stays in sync with code\n- [ ] Searchable documentation site is deployed\n",
