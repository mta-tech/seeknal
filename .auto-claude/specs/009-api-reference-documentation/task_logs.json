It is a collection of tools that help you transform data, store it, and use it for machine learning and data analytics.\n    11→\n    12→Seeknal lets you:\n    13→\n    14→- **Define** data and feature transformations from raw data sources using Pythonic APIs and YAML.\n    15→- **Register** transformations and feature groups by names and get transformed data and features for various use cases including AI/ML modeling, data engineering, business metrics calculation and more.\n    16→- **Share** transformations and feature groups across teams and company.\n    17→\n    18→Seeknal is useful in multiple use cases including:\n    19→\n    20→- AI/ML modeling: computes your feature transformations and incorporates them into your training data, using point-in-time joins to prevent data leakage while supporting the materialization and deployment of your features for online use in production.\n    21→- Data analytics: build data pipelines to extract features and metrics from raw data for Analytics and AI/ML modeling.\n    22→\n    23→Seeknal is designed as a comprehensive data processing tool that enables you to create an end-to-end pipeline by allowing you to utilize one or more data processing engines (such as Apache Spark combined with DuckDB). To facilitate execution across various engines, Seeknal defines the pipeline in JSON format, which the respective engine processes. In this context, the engines need to support JSON input for the pipeline to function correctly. Since some data processors do not naturally handle YAML input, we enhance these data processors to incorporate this feature, which we refer to as engines. These engines are located in the`engines` folder.\n    24→\n    25→## Getting started\n    26→We recommend to use uv for installing Seeknal. The following steps are expecting you to have [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) installed.\n    27→\n    28→\n    29→To install Seeknal, follow these steps:\n    30→\n    31→1. Download the Seeknal package:\n    32→    \n    33→    - Visit the [releases](https://github.com/mta-tech/seeknal/releases) page and download the latest package.\n    34→\n    35→2. Extract the Downloaded File:\n    36→    - Unzip the downloaded zip file to your working directory.\n    37→\n    38→3. Initialize the environment using uv:\n    39→    - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you extracted the files. Then, run the following command to initialize the environment:\n    40→\n    41→    ```\n    42→    $ cd seeknal_build\n    43→    $ uv venv --python 3.11\n    44→    ```\n    45→\n    46→    - Activate the environment:\n    47→\n    48→    ```\n    49→    source .venv/bin/activate  \n    50→    ```\n    51→\n    52→4. Install Seeknal using `uv pip`:\n    53→    ```\n    54→    uv pip install seeknal-<version>-py3-none-any.whl\n    55→    ```\n    56→    Replace <version> with the actual version number of the wheel file you downloaded.\n    57→\n    58→5. Verify the Installation:\n    59→\n    60→    To ensure that Seeknal has been installed correctly, you can run:\n    61→    \n    62→    ```\n    63→    uv pip show seeknal\n    64→    ```\n    65→    This command will display information about the installed package, confirming that the installation was successful.\n    66→\n    67→6. Edit `.env` variable `SEEKNAL_BASE_CONFIG_PATH` and `SEEKNAL_USER_CONFIG_PATH` to point to the directory where you have `config.toml` file. For getting started, we have an example config.toml which you can find inside the `seeknal_build` directory. This case necessary update to the .env to point to the directory.\n    68→\n    69→    ```\n    70→    SEEKNAL_BASE_CONFIG_PATH=\"path/to/seeknal_build\"\n    71→    SEEKNAL_USER_CONFIG_PATH=\"path/to/seeknal_build/config.toml\"\n    72→    ```\n    73→\n    74→Congratulation!\n    75→Your seeknal has been installed on your machine and ready to use in your projects. To see it in action, check out the `feature-store-demo.ipynb` notebook or see it below.\n    76→\n    77→## Seeknal in action\n    78→\n    79→1.

For production or collaborative use of Seeknal, we suggest using [Turso](https://turso.com/) as your database provider. This allows you to share your Seeknal projects seamlessly across teams and environments, given that it operates using the same database. To set up Turso as your database, edit the `config.toml` file and adjust the `context.database` setting accordingly:\n   199→\n   200→```toml\n   201→[context.database]\n   202→TURSO_DATABASE_URL = \"<your-turso-database-url>\"\n   203→TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN = \"<your-turso-auth-token>\"\n   204→```\n   205→\n   206→## Storage Security Best Practices\n   207→\n   208→Seeknal handles potentially sensitive feature data, so it's important to use secure storage paths. By default, Seeknal stores configuration and data in `~/.seeknal/`, which is a secure, user-specific directory.\n   209→\n   210→### Why Avoid `/tmp` and World-Writable Directories\n   211→\n   212→Using `/tmp` or other world-writable directories for data storage creates several security risks:\n   213→\n   214→| Risk | Description |\n   215→|------|-------------|\n   216→| **Data Exposure** | Other users on the system can read your feature data |\n   217→| **Symlink Attacks** | Malicious users can create symlinks to redirect\n\n...

Here's a summary of what I've created:\n\n## Planning Session Complete ✅\n\n### Files Created/Updated:\n\n1. **context.json** - Updated with codebase investigation findings:\n   - Confirmed source code is in `src/seeknal/` (NO `lib/` directory)\n   - Identified Google-style docstring format already in use\n   - Documented existing docstring coverage patterns\n   - Listed key reference files\n\n2. **implementation_plan.json** - Comprehensive 9-phase plan with 33 subtasks:\n   - **Phase 1**: MkDocs Setup (4 subtasks)\n   - **Phase 2**: Docstring Audit (3 subtasks)\n   - **Phase 3**: Core Module Docstrings (4 subtasks)\n   - **Phase 4**: FeatureStore Docstrings (3 subtasks)\n   - **Phase 5**: Tasks Module Docstrings (3 subtasks)\n   - **Phase 6**: API Reference Pages (4 subtasks)\n   - **Phase 7**: Code Examples (5 subtasks)\n   - **Phase 8**: Deployment Setup (3 subtasks)\n   - **Phase 9**: Final Verification (3 subtasks)\n\n3. **init.sh** - Executable setup script that:\n   - Verifies Python 3.11+ and pip\n   - Installs documentation dependencies\n   - Checks configuration\n   - Starts MkDocs development server\n\n4. **build-progress.txt** - Progress tracking document with:\n   - Workflow type and rationale\n   - Phase summary\n   - Investigation findings\n   - Parallelism analysis\n   - Startup commands\n\n### Key Findings from Investigation:\n\n- **Docstring Format**: Google style (already in use in some classes)\n- **Current Coverage**: Partial - classes like `FeatureStoreFileOutput`, `OfflineStore`, and `Entity` have good docstrings, but many methods in `Project`, `Flow`, and other core classes lack documentation\n- **No lib/ directory**: Spec mentioned both `src/` and `lib/`, but only `src/seeknal/` exists\n- **No existing documentation tooling**: Starting from scratch with MkDocs\n\n### Parallelism Opportunities:\n\nPhases 3, 4, and 5 (docstring enhancement) can run in parallel since they:\n- All depend only on Phase 2 (audit)\n- Modify different file sets (core vs featurestore vs tasks)\n- Could save ~30 minutes if parallelized\n\nHowever, **recommended workers: 1** due to the sequential nature of documentation work and minimal parallelism benefits.\n\n---\n\n**IMPORTANT**: These planning files are NOT committed to git (they are gitignored). The implementation will be handled by a separate coder agent.\n\n**My planning session is complete. I have NOT started any implementation work.**",

If True, the task\n            requires a SparkSession for execution.\n        kind: The type identifier for this task (e.g., 'spark', 'duckdb').\n            Used for serialization and task routing.\n        name: Optional name for the task, used for identification and logging.\n        description: Optional description explaining the task's purpose.\n        common: Optional path to a common YAML configuration file containing\n            shared definitions like table schemas or transformations.\n        input: Optional dictionary containing input configuration, including\n            data sources like Hive tables or DataFrames.\n        stages: Optional list of transformation stage dictionaries, each\n            defining a step in the data processing pipeline.\n        output: Optional dictionary containing output configuration, specifying\n            where and how to write the processed data.\n        date: Optional date string for time-based filtering or partitioning\n            of data during processing.\n\n    Example:\n        Subclasses implement specific task types::\n\n            @dataclass\n            class SparkTask(Task):\n                is_spark_job: bool = True\n                kind: str = \"spark\"\n\n                def add_input(self, hive_table=None, dataframe=None):\n                    # Implementation for Spark inputs\n                    ...\n\n                def transform(self, spark, chain=True, ...):\n                    # Spark transformation logic\n                    ...\n    \"\"\"\n\n    is_spark_job: bool\n    kind: str\n    name: Optional[str] = None",

          "detail": "# FeatureStore\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to create and manage feature groups in Seeknal's Feature Store. Feature groups are the primary way to organize, store, and serve features for machine learning models.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore running these examples, ensure you have:\n\n1. Seeknal installed (see [Installation Guide](../index.md#installation))\n2. Project and Entity configured (see [Initialization](initialization.md))\n3. A SparkSession active (Seeknal will create one if needed)\n4. Environment variables configured:\n   ```bash\n   export SEEKNAL_BASE_CONFIG_PATH=\"/path/to/config/directory\"\n   export SEEKNAL_USER_CONFIG_PATH=\"/path/to/config.toml\"\n   ```\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Feature Groups\n\nA **FeatureGroup** is a logical grouping of related features that:\n\n- Share the same entity (e.g., user, product, transaction)\n- Are typically computed from the same data source\n- Support both offline (batch) and online (real-time) materialization\n\n### Materialization\n\n**Materialization** is the process of computing and storing features. Seeknal supports:\n\n- **Offline Store**: For batch processing and training (Delta Lake format)\n- **Online Store**: For low-latency feature serving (Parquet files)\n\n## Creating a Basic Feature Group\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Project and Entity\n\n```python\nfrom seeknal.project import Project\nfrom seeknal.entity import Entity\n\n# Initialize project\nproject = Project(\n    name=\"recommendation_engine\",\n    description=\"Features for product recommendations\"\n)\nproject = project.get_or_create()\n\n# Create entity\nuser_entity = Entity(\n    name=\"user\",\n    join_keys=[\"user_id\"],\n    description=\"User entity for recommendation features\"\n)\nuser_entity = user_entity.get_or_create()\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create a Data Flow\n\n```python\nfrom seeknal.flow import Flow, FlowInput, FlowOutput, FlowOutputEnum\nfrom seeknal.tasks.sparkengine import SparkEngineTask\n\n# Define input source\nflow_input = FlowInput(\n    path=\"/data/user_activity.parquet\",\n    format=\"parquet\"\n)\n\n# Create transformation task\ntransform_task = SparkEngineTask().add_stage(\n    class_name=\"tech.mta.seeknal.transformers.SelectExpr\",\n    params={\n        \"expressions\": [\n            \"user_id\",\n            \"event_date\",\n            \"COUNT(*) as activity_count\",\n            \"SUM(purchase_amount) as total_spend\"\n        ]\n    }\n)\n\n# Build the flow\nuser_activity_flow = Flow(\n    name=\"user_activity_features\",\n    input=flow_input,\n    tasks=[transform_task],\n    output=FlowOutput(kind=FlowOutputEnum.SPARK_DATAFRAME)\n)\nuser_activity_flow = user_activity_flow.get_or_create()\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create Feature Group with Materialization\n\n```python\nfrom seeknal.featurestore import FeatureGroup, Materialization\n\n# Configure materialization settings\nmaterialization = Materialization(",

The documentation will be built using MkDocs with the Material theme and mkdocstrings plugin, creating a searchable, deployed documentation site that covers all public classes, functions, and configurations with practical code examples.

The documentation will be built using MkDocs with the Material theme and mkdocstrings plugin, creating a searchable, deployed documentation site that covers all public classes, functions, and configurations with practical code examples. This addresses the known gap where the current README is insufficient for production use, enabling developers to understand available APIs without diving into source code.\n     6→\n     7→## Workflow Type\n     8→\n     9→**Type**: feature\n    10→\n    11→**Rationale**: This is a new feature addition to the project infrastructure.

This is a common pattern and doesn't affect documentation quality. Adding type annotations to all functions would be a significant refactoring effort outside the scope of this documentation task.\n\n### Progress:\n- **Build Progress**: 91% (29/32 subtasks)\n- **Phase 8 (Documentation Deployment Setup)**: Complete ✅\n- **Next**: Phase 9 - Final Verification and Testing",
