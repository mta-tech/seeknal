It is a collection of tools that help you transform data, store it, and use it for machine learning and data analytics.\n    11→\n    12→Seeknal lets you:\n    13→\n    14→- **Define** data and feature transformations from raw data sources using Pythonic APIs and YAML.\n    15→- **Register** transformations and feature groups by names and get transformed data and features for various use cases including AI/ML modeling, data engineering, business metrics calculation and more.\n    16→- **Share** transformations and feature groups across teams and company.\n    17→\n    18→Seeknal is useful in multiple use cases including:\n    19→\n    20→- AI/ML modeling: computes your feature transformations and incorporates them into your training data, using point-in-time joins to prevent data leakage while supporting the materialization and deployment of your features for online use in production.\n    21→- Data analytics: build data pipelines to extract features and metrics from raw data for Analytics and AI/ML modeling.\n    22→\n    23→Seeknal is designed as a comprehensive data processing tool that enables you to create an end-to-end pipeline by allowing you to utilize one or more data processing engines (such as Apache Spark combined with DuckDB). To facilitate execution across various engines, Seeknal defines the pipeline in JSON format, which the respective engine processes. In this context, the engines need to support JSON input for the pipeline to function correctly. Since some data processors do not naturally handle YAML input, we enhance these data processors to incorporate this feature, which we refer to as engines. These engines are located in the`engines` folder.\n    24→\n    25→## Getting started\n    26→We recommend to use uv for installing Seeknal. The following steps are expecting you to have [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) installed.\n    27→\n    28→\n    29→To install Seeknal, follow these steps:\n    30→\n    31→1. Download the Seeknal package:\n    32→    \n    33→    - Visit the [releases](https://github.com/mta-tech/seeknal/releases) page and download the latest package.\n    34→\n    35→2. Extract the Downloaded File:\n    36→    - Unzip the downloaded zip file to your working directory.\n    37→\n    38→3. Initialize the environment using uv:\n    39→    - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you extracted the files. Then, run the following command to initialize the environment:\n    40→\n    41→    ```\n    42→    $ cd seeknal_build\n    43→    $ uv venv --python 3.11\n    44→    ```\n    45→\n    46→    - Activate the environment:\n    47→\n    48→    ```\n    49→    source .venv/bin/activate  \n    50→    ```\n    51→\n    52→4. Install Seeknal using `uv pip`:\n    53→    ```\n    54→    uv pip install seeknal-<version>-py3-none-any.whl\n    55→    ```\n    56→    Replace <version> with the actual version number of the wheel file you downloaded.\n    57→\n    58→5. Verify the Installation:\n    59→\n    60→    To ensure that Seeknal has been installed correctly, you can run:\n    61→    \n    62→    ```\n    63→    uv pip show seeknal\n    64→    ```\n    65→    This command will display information about the installed package, confirming that the installation was successful.\n    66→\n    67→6. Edit `.env` variable `SEEKNAL_BASE_CONFIG_PATH` and `SEEKNAL_USER_CONFIG_PATH` to point to the directory where you have `config.toml` file. For getting started, we have an example config.toml which you can find inside the `seeknal_build` directory. This case necessary update to the .env to point to the directory.\n    68→\n    69→    ```\n    70→    SEEKNAL_BASE_CONFIG_PATH=\"path/to/seeknal_build\"\n    71→    SEEKNAL_USER_CONFIG_PATH=\"path/to/seeknal_build/config.toml\"\n    72→    ```\n    73→\n    74→Congratulation!\n    75→Your seeknal has been installed on your machine and ready to use in your projects. To see it in action, check out the `feature-store-demo.ipynb` notebook or see it below.\n    76→\n    77→## Seeknal in action\n    78→\n    79→1.

For production or collaborative use of Seeknal, we suggest using [Turso](https://turso.com/) as your database provider. This allows you to share your Seeknal projects seamlessly across teams and environments, given that it operates using the same database. To set up Turso as your database, edit the `config.toml` file and adjust the `context.database` setting accordingly:\n   199→\n   200→```toml\n   201→[context.database]\n   202→TURSO_DATABASE_URL = \"<your-turso-database-url>\"\n   203→TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN = \"<your-turso-auth-token>\"\n   204→```\n   205→\n   206→## Storage Security Best Practices\n   207→\n   208→Seeknal handles potentially sensitive feature data, so it's important to use secure storage paths. By default, Seeknal stores configuration and data in `~/.seeknal/`, which is a secure, user-specific directory.\n   209→\n   210→### Why Avoid `/tmp` and World-Writable Directories\n   211→\n   212→Using `/tmp` or other world-writable directories for data storage creates several security risks:\n   213→\n   214→| Risk | Description |\n   215→|------|-------------|\n   216→| **Data Exposure** | Other users on the system can read your feature data |\n   217→| **Symlink Attacks** | Malicious users can create symlinks to redirect\n\n...

Here's a summary of what I've created:\n\n## Planning Session Complete ✅\n\n### Files Created/Updated:\n\n1. **context.json** - Updated with codebase investigation findings:\n   - Confirmed source code is in `src/seeknal/` (NO `lib/` directory)\n   - Identified Google-style docstring format already in use\n   - Documented existing docstring coverage patterns\n   - Listed key reference files\n\n2. **implementation_plan.json** - Comprehensive 9-phase plan with 33 subtasks:\n   - **Phase 1**: MkDocs Setup (4 subtasks)\n   - **Phase 2**: Docstring Audit (3 subtasks)\n   - **Phase 3**: Core Module Docstrings (4 subtasks)\n   - **Phase 4**: FeatureStore Docstrings (3 subtasks)\n   - **Phase 5**: Tasks Module Docstrings (3 subtasks)\n   - **Phase 6**: API Reference Pages (4 subtasks)\n   - **Phase 7**: Code Examples (5 subtasks)\n   - **Phase 8**: Deployment Setup (3 subtasks)\n   - **Phase 9**: Final Verification (3 subtasks)\n\n3. **init.sh** - Executable setup script that:\n   - Verifies Python 3.11+ and pip\n   - Installs documentation dependencies\n   - Checks configuration\n   - Starts MkDocs development server\n\n4. **build-progress.txt** - Progress tracking document with:\n   - Workflow type and rationale\n   - Phase summary\n   - Investigation findings\n   - Parallelism analysis\n   - Startup commands\n\n### Key Findings from Investigation:\n\n- **Docstring Format**: Google style (already in use in some classes)\n- **Current Coverage**: Partial - classes like `FeatureStoreFileOutput`, `OfflineStore`, and `Entity` have good docstrings, but many methods in `Project`, `Flow`, and other core classes lack documentation\n- **No lib/ directory**: Spec mentioned both `src/` and `lib/`, but only `src/seeknal/` exists\n- **No existing documentation tooling**: Starting from scratch with MkDocs\n\n### Parallelism Opportunities:\n\nPhases 3, 4, and 5 (docstring enhancement) can run in parallel since they:\n- All depend only on Phase 2 (audit)\n- Modify different file sets (core vs featurestore vs tasks)\n- Could save ~30 minutes if parallelized\n\nHowever, **recommended workers: 1** due to the sequential nature of documentation work and minimal parallelism benefits.\n\n---\n\n**IMPORTANT**: These planning files are NOT committed to git (they are gitignored). The implementation will be handled by a separate coder agent.\n\n**My planning session is complete. I have NOT started any implementation work.**",

It is a collection of tools that help you transform data, store it, and use it for machine learning and data analytics.\n    11→\n    12→Seeknal lets you:\n    13→\n    14→- **Define** data and feature transformations from raw data sources using Pythonic APIs and YAML.\n    15→- **Register** transformations and feature groups by names and get transformed data and features for various use cases including AI/ML modeling, data engineering, business metrics calculation and more.\n    16→- **Share** transformations and feature groups across teams and company.\n    17→\n    18→Seeknal is useful in multiple use cases including:\n    19→\n    20→- AI/ML modeling: computes your feature transformations and incorporates them into your training data, using point-in-time joins to prevent data leakage while supporting the materialization and deployment of your features for online use in production.\n    21→- Data analytics: build data pipelines to extract features and metrics from raw data for Analytics and AI/ML modeling.\n    22→\n    23→Seeknal is designed as a comprehensive data processing tool that enables you to create an end-to-end pipeline by allowing you to utilize one or more data processing engines (such as Apache Spark combined with DuckDB). To facilitate execution across various engines, Seeknal defines the pipeline in JSON format, which the respective engine processes. In this context, the engines need to support JSON input for the pipeline to function correctly. Since some data processors do not naturally handle YAML input, we enhance these data processors to incorporate this feature, which we refer to as engines. These engines are located in the`engines` folder.\n    24→\n    25→## Getting started\n    26→We recommend to use uv for installing Seeknal. The following steps are expecting you to have [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) installed.\n    27→\n    28→\n    29→To install Seeknal, follow these steps:\n    30→\n    31→1. Download the Seeknal package:\n    32→    \n    33→    - Visit the [releases](https://github.com/mta-tech/seeknal/releases) page and download the latest package.\n    34→\n    35→2. Extract the Downloaded File:\n    36→    - Unzip the downloaded zip file to your working directory.\n    37→\n    38→3. Initialize the environment using uv:\n    39→    - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you extracted the files. Then, run the following command to initialize the environment:\n    40→\n    41→    ```\n    42→    $ cd seeknal_build\n    43→    $ uv venv --python 3.11\n    44→    ```\n    45→\n    46→    - Activate the environment:\n    47→\n    48→    ```\n    49→    source .venv/bin/activate  \n    50→    ```\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.
